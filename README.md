# Hi there 👋

### 🔭 What I Do
* **Hardware:** I design custom PCBs and handle manual assembly/reflow.
* **Firmware:** I write C/C++ across the stack—from bare-metal firmware and hardware debugging to high-level Windows desktop applications using Win32/Windows APIs.
* **Software:** I use JavaScript for backend logic and frontend dashboards.
* **Reverse Engineering:** I dig into protocols and hardware interfaces to understand how things tick.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Most repositories here are real projects or active experiments involving physical hardware.
